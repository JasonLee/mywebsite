<h1 class="post-title"> Hello </h1>

<h2> Hi, I'm Jason. </h2>

I'm a CS graduate from the UK who just moved to the US.

I enjoy programming and have worked on a few personal projects as well as completed a software engineer internship.

I've used Java and JavaScript in the past, during my internship. My favorite language at the moment is python, since its quite quick and easy
to prototype something, and I like how there are libraries for everything.

I am always on the lookout for challenging opportunities and am currently open to hiring.
